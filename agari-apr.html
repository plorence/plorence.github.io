            <p><strong>Agari Phishing Response</strong> is a tool designed to quickly triage employee-submitted phishing messages. I designed the product from its inception after on-site visits to several large Agari customers in the airline, publishing, and insurance industries. Regardless of their industry, email administrators at these organizations had the same fundamental problem: every employee in my organization has a "Report phishing" button in their email client; how can I quickly and efficiently respond to a constant stream of employee submissions of suspicious messages?</p>

            <p>Through a series of interviews, we discovered that administrators followed the same general workflow:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Begin the triage process.</strong><br>
                - Receive employee-submitted suspected phish message into a queue.<br>
                Optionally contact the submitter and train on how to re-submit the message as an attachment to obtain the full, original headers instead of just forwarding the message.<br>
                - Deconstruct the message into its component parts: message headers, attachments, URLs, message body content.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Determine: Is this message bad?</strong><br>
                Using free or open-source tools, evaluate each component:<br>
                • message header analysis (mxtoolbox.com or other DNS blacklist tools)<br>
                • attachment analysis (VirusTotal or on-premises sandbox like FireEye)<br>
                • URL analysis (VirusTotal or urlscan.io)</li>
                
                <li><strong>Determine: What other similar messages came in? Who was impacted and how?</strong><br>
                Using internal search tools (O365 or Splunk), determine if other employees were impacted.<br>
                Some users referred to this step as "determining the blast radius" of the malicious campaign.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Take action: What should I do about it?</strong><br>
                - Remove messages from inboxes of all affected employees.<br>
                - Document actions / results in a report or ticketing system.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./agari-apr_files/air-2.jpg" alt="Problem statement slide showing the phishing response workflow">
            </div>

            <p>This process was condensed to a single-slide problem statement we shared with potential customers and our executive staff:</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./agari-apr_files/air-1_orig.png" alt="Problem statement slide showing SOC analyst workflow">
            </div>

            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #6c757d;">SOC = Security Operations Center &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FP = False Positive</p>

            <p>We were aware of related tools in this space, but those tools were aimed more at employee training through phishing <em>simulation</em>. For example, a tool like KnowBe4 or Cofense/PhishMe can deliberately send well-crafted phishing messages to an employee base, track which users "took the bait" and therefore require additional training.</p>

            <p>Most organizations also struggled with an initial triage, or scanning. For example, given a list of 45 submissions, where should we focus first on the newest submissions, or the oldest in the queue? It might make sense to focus on the oldest (a first-in / first-out strategy), unless, of course, those older messages proved to be benign.</p>

            <p>Below is the initial mind-map we created to capture use cases. Through interviews, we learned that administrators treated every user submission as a discrete "investigation," and their mental model mapped things like "assignee" and "remediation state" to each investigation. Some administrators reported spending 1-2 hours per investigation, and, in some organizations, they reported <em>never</em> being able to keep up with the constant onslaught of submissions.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./agari-apr_files/air-1-5_orig.png" alt="Mind map showing use cases and workflow">
            </div>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./agari-apr_files/air-3-5_orig.png" alt="Detailed workflow diagram">
            </div>

            <p>We realized that in order to be valuable, the tool must at least provide an initial analysis (automation), and – like Agari Phishing Defense – having a human-readable rendering of the message contents would be extremely helpful in aiding quick confirmation, answering the question, "Is the employee reporting a true phishing attack, or is this just a benign (but annoying) marketing campaign?"</p>

            <p>Based on these ideas, I created some low-fidelity mockups for an initial design aimed at helping users answer that key question quickly by combining a human-readable portion in the top pane with the results of the automated analysis in the bottom pane:</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./agari-apr_files/air-6_orig.png" alt="Low-fidelity mockup showing message analysis interface">
            </div>

            <p>Because the tool is fundamentally a list management workflow (list/detail design pattern), the tool must provide easy sort and filter options on the index of investigations as well as a quick way to drill into the details of a selected investigation:</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./agari-apr_files/air-4_orig.png" alt="List view showing investigation index">
            </div>

            <p>For each item (investigation) in the index view, we tried to fit as much succinct information into as small a space as possible. We employed progressive disclosure techniques to display additional information. Moving to a high-fidelity interactive prototype, we gathered more customer feedback from select users.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./agari-apr_files/air-7_orig.png" alt="High-fidelity prototype showing investigation details">
            </div>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./agari-apr_files/air-8_orig.png" alt="Detailed investigation view with analysis results">
            </div>

            <p>Users were generally happy with the approach and framing; their feedback was to get more succinct information and summaries into the investigations index.</p>

            <p>Based on this feedback, we refined the "selected" state of an investigation on the index view to also show the HTML rendering of the message. For each user-submission, we created a "tile" to include the following pieces of information:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Unique investigation ID</li>
                <li>Initial system-generated categorization</li>
                <li>Initial system-generated severity</li>
                <li>Assignee</li>
                <li>Reporter</li>
                <li>Timestamp of submission / age</li>
                <li>From and Subject of reported message</li>
                <li>Count of similar messages found (impact)</li>
                <li>Message Trust Score of reported message</li>
                <li>Count and analysis of URLs</li>
                <li>Count and analysis of attachments</li>
                <li>Count and analysis of domains</li>
                <li>Count and analysis of IPs</li>
            </ol>

            <p>A tile could be selected to display the HTML rendering before drilling into the details around similar messages.</p>

            <p>Once we had confirmation that the information architecture of the product was sound, I created a detailed style guide for bespoke components:</p>

            <!-- Image Gallery -->
            <div class="gallery">
                <div class="gallery-nav">

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Agari Phishing Response employs several design tenets:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>"Follow the red."</strong> Given a long and complex list of components with varying indicators of "badness," a user only needs to focus on the red glyphs (like indicator lights in a dashboard) to determine which submissions require immediate attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Every organization will have a different threshold and priority system.</strong> Strive to provide the necessary information consistently and objectively, and users will develop their own sense of how many indicators of "badness" equate to a critical/high/medium/low severity.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The final design of the Analyst page (list of investigations) with HTML rendering:</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="./agari-apr_files/air-18_orig.png" alt="Final analyst page design showing investigation list with HTML rendering">
            </div>

            <p>By integrating with the cybersecurity industry's leading third-party forensic tools and automating investigation and remediation workflows, Agari Phishing Response customers have reported that their phishing response times have decreased by as much as 95% – saving thousands of hours of analyst time and helping to contain breaches before damage is done.</p>
